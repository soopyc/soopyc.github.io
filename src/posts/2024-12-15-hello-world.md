summary: my first ever blog post on the new site!
---

Hello world! This is my first ever actual blog post. I've just moved from
SvelteKit and rewrote the entire site in Astro.

I am actually a little surprised I managed to come up with the design and the
code to write this in mere 5 days. This is kind of an unthinkable task for me,
as I always procrastinate and delay things for as much as possible. (partly due
to depression.)

I might add webmention support later on.

## Update (2024-12-16)

Added webmention support! This currently trusts webmention.io responses to be
correct and not explode.

Also, link rot is real. When reading the multitude of docs for indieweb and
microformats2, there are so many dead links lying around. at least the important
content aren't dead.
